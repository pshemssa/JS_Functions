# TaskFlow Web Application 

This **TaskFlow Web Application** is a clean, interactive task-management application built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, edit, delete, filter, and complete tasks with a simple, responsive UI powered entirely by frontend technologies — no frameworks required.
